Main idea: When a proposition gets connectives it becomes a complex one:
a) complex
b) no, it's not true or false, because this isn't a proposition. (last two don't have a boolean state)
c) simple
d) complex
e) no, it's not true or false, because this isn't a proposition.
f) no, it's not true or false, because this isn't a proposition.
g) Depends if you consider it all as just one proposition, but if you consider just 'elephants exist' and negate it. Then by negating you make it a complex proposition.
h) Complex, there is no way to form this proposition without using a connective, so yeah it becomes one.
